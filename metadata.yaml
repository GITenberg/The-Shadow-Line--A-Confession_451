description: "The Shadow-Line is a short novel based at sea by Joseph Conrad; it is\
  \ one of his later works, being written from February to December 1915. It was first\
  \ published in 1916 as a serial in New York's Metropolitan Magazine (September—October)\
  \ in the English Review (September 1916-March 1917) and published in book form in\
  \ 1917 in the UK (March) and America (April). The novella depicts the development\
  \ of a young man upon taking a captaincy in the Orient, with the shadow line of\
  \ the title representing the threshold of this development.\nThe novella is notable\
  \ for its dual narrative structure. The full, subtitled title of the novel is The\
  \ Shadow-Line, A Confession, which immediately alerts the reader to the retrospective\
  \ nature of the novella. The ironic constructions following from the conflict between\
  \ the 'young' protagonist (who is never named) and the 'old' drive much of the underlying\
  \ points of the novella, namely the nature of wisdom, experience and maturity. Conrad\
  \ also extensively uses irony by comparison in the work, with characters such as\
  \ Captain Giles and the ship's 'factotum' Ransome used to emphasise strengths and\
  \ weaknesses of the protagonist.\nThe novella has often been cited as a metaphor\
  \ of the First World War, given its timing and references to a long struggle, the\
  \ importance of camaraderie, etc. This viewpoint may also be reinforced by the knowledge\
  \ that Conrad's elder son, Borys, was wounded in the First World War. Others however\
  \ see the novel as having a strong supernatural influence, referring to various\
  \ plot-lines in the novella such as the 'ghost' of the previous captain potentially\
  \ cursing the ship, and the madness of first mate Mr Burns. Conrad himself, however,\
  \ denied this link in his 'Author's Note' (1920), claiming that although critics\
  \ had attempted to show this link, \"The world of the living contains enough marvels\
  \ and mysteries as it is.\"\nAndrzej Wajda has made a 1976 film adaptation of the\
  \ novel under its Polish title - Smuga cienia.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
